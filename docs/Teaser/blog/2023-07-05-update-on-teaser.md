# Life update and Teaser

Hi everybody.

I've decided that I want to spend a few months working on other projects that I'm more passionate about and my studies at UNSW. My next project is going to be a online gallery inspired by [awwwards.com](https://www.awwwards.com/) and [play.unity](https://play.unity.com/) to showcase the most beautiful WebGL animations / websites on the internet.

I liked working on Teaser though, and I'll still be available to review pull requests. Please get in touch with teaseradmin@teasernsfw.com if you've contributed to this project so I can add you as a collaborator.
