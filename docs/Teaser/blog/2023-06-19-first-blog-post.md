# What's coming in June?

I'm going to write a monthly blog post planning out what I hope to accomplish each month! Here's what coming in June!

I'm finishing my CS degree at UNSW this year, so I'll be dedicating more time to that than Teaser.
I also need to find a job, otherwise I can't make rent in Sydney lol.

### What I want to work on:

| Image | Explaination of functionality   |
| ---   | ---   |
| ![Nested comments and replies](/blog/2023-06-19-comments.png) | <ul><li>Implementing nested comments with a nested ordering created in the backend.</li><li>Display comment counts at the top of the comment modal.</li><li>Link replies to comments in the frontend.</li></ul>  |
| ![Profile page changes](/blog/2023-06-19-profile.png) | <ul><li>Upload your own profile picture.</li><li>Edit your profile description</li><li>Show separate tabs from liked and bookmarked posts in the frontend</li></ul> |
| ![General Feed function](/blog/2023-06-19-general-posts-function.png) |  <ul><li>Fix the `get_general_feed_service()` service function to display all posts regardless of category?</li><li>I want to define the psuedocode and discuss a suitable recommendation algorithm for users who haven't logged in.</li></ul>  |

### Anything else I want to discuss?

- I don't know anything about managing an open source project. I'll do some research on how to communicate properly with new contributors in open-source, how to manage tasks and improve my technical skills!
- I'm planning on making a [Show HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36398582) post soon. I'll be posting Teaser on [EarlyWork Village](https://www.earlywork.co/community), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nathanyin_tiktok-reverseengineering-reactnative-activity-7076381313808674816-q_5f?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) and Reddit. Anybody know any niche subreddits that would fit Teaser?
- I want a way to get feedback on these blog posts and on Teaser in general! If I have time, I'll start working on deploying a forum to separate technical issues on github from other discussion of Teaser and related topics!
