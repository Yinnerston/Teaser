I\'ll do some research on how to communicate properly with new contributors in open-source, how to manage tasks and improve my technical skills!\\n- I\'m planning on making a [Show HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36398582) post soon. I\'ll be posting Teaser on [EarlyWork Village](https://www.earlywork.co/community), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nathanyin_tiktok-reverseengineering-reactnative-activity-7076381313808674816-q_5f?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) and Reddit. Anybody know any niche subreddits that would fit Teaser?\\n- I want a way to get feedback on these blog posts and on Teaser in general! If I have time, I\'ll start working on deploying a forum to separate technical issues on github from other discussion of Teaser and related topics!"}]}')}}]);
